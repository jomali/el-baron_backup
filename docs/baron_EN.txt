The bronze doors fall closed behind you, and you hear the scraping sound of heavy bolts drawn across them. That’s all right–you can handle this alone. With your axe raised in one gauntletted hand you step forward, into the heat.

The bone-strewn vestibule
This small rectangular hall has been chiselled painstakingly from the rock. The walls and ceiling are covered with slabs of black marble. Two bronze doors seal off the exit to the south, while to the north a narrow passageway leads on to the dragon's fiery lair. Blackened bones and skulls litter the floor, casting long shadows in the flickering light.

>x walls
The walls and the ceiling of the hall are covered with smooth sheets of black marble. White veins running through them form intricate patterns.

>x patterns
As you let your gaze dwell over the patterns, you are struck by the thought that they somehow encode a meaning, that beneath their apparent chaos lies the solution to a grave mystery. But before you can even start understanding them, the lines begin to move, to spin, to swirl--you feel dizziness overtaking you, and quickly focus your eyes elsewhere.

>x doors
Two massive bronze doors block the cave's exit. The likeness of a burning man has been engraved on them.

> x man
Instead of the pain you would expect on the face of a burning man, the  graven figure’s expression speaks of craving and desire. He does not suffer from the flames, but basks in them.

>open them
The doors have been bolted from the other side, and not even the dragon could open them from here. In fact, that is the entire point. You have been instructed to knock after you have defeated the dragon.

> knock on doors
Before you have even tried to kill the dragon? You are no coward.

>x bones
The ground is covered by bones and skulls, blackened but otherwise untouched by the fire that consumed the flesh they once bore.

>smell
The penetrating smell of sulphur fills the entire cave.

>i
You are carrying:
  a helmet (being worn)
  a full suit of armour (being worn)
  a battle axe

>x axe
For this fight you have brought your heaviest battle axe. Few beside you could even lift it, let alone handle it with lethal speed and precision.

>x armour
You wouldn't want to face the monster without a full suit of armour, thick plate over chainmail, generously oiled, granting optimal protection against all kinds of physical attack. The suit has been fastened with leather straps at the back.

>x helmet
A practical helmet, without fancy plumes or spikes. The visor is open, leaving your sight unobstructed but exposing your face to attack.

>close visor
You close the visor of the helmet.

>n
You try to step around the human bones, but with each step several are crushed under the combined weight of you and your armour.

A low passage
The passageway is very low, making you stoop as you walk through. A thick layer of ashes covers the floor. Fierce light and massive waves of heat come from the north, where huge flames fill the dragon's cave. You are sweating heavily inside your armour--and not entirely through the heat. To the south lies the coolness of the vestibule.

>x flames
Flames bigger than men illuminate the hall to the north.

>n
Holding the axe tightly, the visor of your helmet closed--less honourable, but more prudent--, you approach the dragon.

Huge underground hall
This hall--apparently a natural cave--is huge, much bigger than even the Emperor's throne room. The floor is covered with thick layers of ash, except where huge flames shoot upwards out of cracks and fissures that cleave the rock. The heat here is almost unbearable.

The dragon, an enormous red scaly monster, lies on the ground in the middle of the hall. It stares at you with a big yellow eye.

>x dragon
You thought you expected the worst, but you were not prepared for this. Yes, it is large--at least thirty meters from the tip of its tail to its evil head--but you have fought large monsters before. Yes, its angry red scales gleam like hard steel and look as if no normal weapon could pierce them--but your axe is no normal weapon. But the fire in its eyes and its throat, the play of flames behind the dragon's rows of pale teeth, seems suddenly more horrifying than anything you ever saw before. This is not just another monster with fiery breath. This is not even an elemental, those mindless creatures that embody the very forces of nature. No--this is more terrifying, more intimate, more evil--something indomitable, something that will never yield and that can never be exploited, that unlike nature's laws will not yield to the desires of men--for you recognise this fire, this monster, this beast, and all men would recognise it, for it dwells within the innermost soul of all of us, and always has, and always will, and you know there is no way you can defeat it. And yet you must try.

The dragon raises itself from the ground and approaches you, each heavy step rocking the cave floor and threatening to throw you off balance. But quick reflexes and decades of experience with heavy armour allow you to remain upright; and when you raise an angry fist at the monster, defying his threatening glare, you look positively heroic--a true knight, from a true faerytale.

>attack dragon
Raising the axe, you step towards the dragon. "Your knell has rung," you inform it, surprised at your own confidence. "It's time to die."

The monster looks at you impassively. You cannot help but stare at its double rows of arm-long teeth as you charge, but charge you do, screaming with justified rage. Then--as fast and sudden as lightning--a jet of fire bursts from dragon's the mouth and envelops you from head to toe. The pain is beyond comprehension.

>attack dragon
With heroic willpower you resist the numbing pain and charge again: the monster must die, though your life be the price. Through the flames, you see the pale malicious circles of its eyes and raise your axe to plant it right between them. But suddenly the dragon's tail swings in from the side and hits you, sending you flying through the hall in dizzying arc that ends when your head crashes into a wall. Your helmet softens the blow, and you quickly regain your senses. Unfortunately, when you open your eyes, the dragon's monstrous head is already approaching you, its mouth wide open--and once again it bathes you in deadly fire. Death comes quickly.

   THE BARON

   An interactive story by Victor Gijsbers.




 Chi l'anima mi lacera?
 Chi m'agita le viscere?
 Che strazio, ohimè, che smania!
 Che inferno, che terror!


 "Who lacerates my soul?
  Who tortures my body?
  What torment, oh me, what agony!
  What a Hell! What a terror!"




    From the opera "Don Giovanni"
    Text: Lorenzo da Ponte
    Music: Wolfgang A. Mozart



A penetrating, dissonant sound twice breaks the silence of the night, waking you from restless sleep. After the second note the church bell falls silent, and the stillness of the winter night settles over the village once again. You rub the sleep from your eyes. Very carefully, because you do not wish to wake your wife Hilde, you step out of the bed. She would certainly try to stop you.






In your bedroom
The weak light of the moon, which enters the room through the window, envelops the furniture of the bedroom in a cloak of unworldly beauty. Only the soft breathing of your wife in the large bed breaches the silence. The door next to the heavy oaken wardrobe leads to the landing to the north. It is ice cold in the unheated room.

On the chair are your work clothes.

You can see a pine night table here.

>x wife
You lean forward to better see Hilde's face; for just a moment she seems to go rigid and her breathing falters before resuming its steady rhythm. But you know enough--she is awake! She knows where you are going, but pretends to be asleep. A quiet approval she'd never be able to express in words? Or is she simply too afraid to confront you?

>x clothes
These are the clothes you wear when you go to fell trees in the woods on weekdays: tough jeans, a red-blue checkered shirt and two heavy leather boots. A faint smell of sweat hangs around the shirt.

>take them
Taken.

>wear them
You put on your work clothes.

>x table
A simple night table made of pinewood, the very first piece of furniture you ever made. On the night table is a family photo.

>x photo
This photograph, made for the tenth anniversary of your marriage to Hilde, is a few years old. Solemnly, you stand next to each other like two black-and-white statues, once again clad in your wedding clothes. In the foreground, close against you, stands your daughter Maartje--little Maartje, in her beautiful white dress, a radiant smile on her face. In the picture you have laid a protective arm across her shoulder--but now she has been kidnapped by the evil baron. Once again you vow to do everything possible to free her.

>x door
The close-fitting door separates your bedroom from the landing, and hence from the rest of the house.

>open it
You open the door to the landing.

>n

On the landing
The landing is enveloped by uneven darkness. Moonlight enters through the open door to your bedroom in the south. A red door to the north leads to the room of your daughter Maartje. Next to the stairs down stands an elegant cupboard, above which hangs a large ornate mirror in a gilded frame.

>n
(opening the door to Maartje's room)

In Maartje's room
Without Maartje's radiant presence, her room seems dead and empty. It is a dreary sight: a bed in which nobody sleeps, a dollhouse with which nobody plays, a desk behind which nobody studies. The gay colours in which you painted her ceiling and furniture appear in the pale light of the stars as a pallet of greys. The door to the south leads back to the landing.

On the desk is a diary.

You can see a teddy here.

>x diary
The book, bound in fake red leather, must be a diary, since it is locked by a small copper lock. But although you burn with curiosity, you will not damage Maartje's diary.

>x teddy
Brown has been Maartje's favourite toy animal and most loyal companion for years. The smile on his face is reassuring, and even if his eyes are merely buttons, some kind of intelligence seems to reside in them.

>take it
Taken.

>s

On the landing
The landing is enveloped by uneven darkness. Moonlight enters through the open door to your bedroom in the south. To the north, the red door to Maartje's room is slightly ajar. Next to the stairs down stands an elegant cupboard, above which hangs a large ornate mirror in a gilded frame.

>d
Cautiously you seek your way downwards through the darkness. In the hall you grab your winter coat and put it on, then you open the front door and step outside into the garden.


In the garden
Your front garden too has been buried by a thick layer of snow, which hides all plants from view. Only a few bare bushes that crouch against the garden fence penetrate the white blanket. Behind you, the front door leads back into the house, while the road to the east winds through the village and the forest to the baron's castle. From his unreachable heights the moon looks reproachfully down on you. The tip of the church tower can be seen above the houses on the other side of the road.

You can see a letterbox (which is closed) and an axe here.

>x axe
This is your most important tool. Without doubt you have felled thousands of trees with it. The axe is well-honed, has a good balance, and with your muscles the weight is no problem at all. You will probably be able to cleave the baron's head in a single blow.

>take it
Taken.

>x letterbox
A small letterbox hangs on the outside of the garden fence.

>open it
You open the letterbox, revealing a letter from the baron.

>read letter
In elegant handwriting, a message has been written on the parchment:

To Maartje's parents,

With this letter I want to tell you that your daughter Maartje has been taken from your home and brought to my castle at my command. Do not worry: she is safe here and is well taken care of. Do not try to visit Maartje or take her away from me; my castle is heavily guarded and you would only risk your own well-being.

I understand that it must be difficult for you to lose your daughter, and I apologise for your suffering. What is my motive? I love her, and I cannot live without her at my side. With me she will be happy, I promise that on my honour and my hope of salvation. Someday you will understand that this is the best possible situation.

The Baron.

Trembling with anger you stare at the signature at the bottom of the page.

>x church
The top of the church tower just peeks above the houses on the other side of the street, like a black finger against the star-filled sky.

>e
A second you hesitate, but then you determinedly step onto the road towards the dark forest. No sign of life is apparent in the village. Slowly you become angry at all your neighbours and fellow villagers. Where are they when you need them? Why is there not a single one among them with the guts to free Maartje? A lack of love--that is what enables people to ignore the problems of others. Everybody knows what has happened--but nobody does anything, because nobody feels responsible.

After several minutes you reach the edge of the woods. It is like walking into the dark jaws of a gigantic and evil beast to follow the path under the overhanging foliage of the coniferous trees. The light of the moon hardly reaches the ground, and several times you stumble over large branches that lie in wait under the snow like traps.

But you firmly step onwards while you try to devise a plan for entering the baron's castle. Then, suddenly, the howling of wolves starts you out of your reflections. It is hard to judge, but you would be surprised if they are more than a kilometer away from you. And it is at least another ten kilometers eastward to the baron's castle.


Walking through the forest
You make your way through the dim and gloomy forest, hardly able to recognise the snow-covered path in this darkness. Howls penetrate the midnight air: wolves, nearby. Game is scarce in these harsh winter months, so the wolves are hungry, bold, and they can be a danger even to men. West goes back to the village, while the baron's castle lies farther east.

>e

Walking through the forest
The path here is narrow and winding, and you have to move forward with care and attention, lest you wander into the forest and lose your way completely. Bleak puddles lie on the snow wherever the moon manages to penetrate the foliage. Going eastwards will bring you to the baron's castle; in the opposite direction, your footprints lead back to the safety of the village.

Suddenly, a dark shape jumps growling from the trees and onto the path, blocking your way. A she-wolf. She stares at you with fierce eyes that mirror the moon.

>x wolf
A large wolf, exceptionally so, but winter has clearly taken its toll on her: she is lean and scrawny, and her fur is dirty and dull.

The she-wolf reveals two rows of sharp teeth and takes a few small steps towards you. From the woods a young wolf skulks towards her. He is no bigger than a cat, and very lean.

>e
Are you sure you want to try to walk past the ferocious she-wolf?
y

Step by step you inch forward, keeping as close to the trees as possible. The wolf growls dangerously, her fangs bared and her eyes fixed on your throat.

"Show no fear!", you counsel yourself. "Be brave! Those despicable creatures only attack those weaker than themselves."

Your face a mask of dominance and control, you walk past the she-wolf. For a moment you wonder whether the sound of your heart--a madman locked in a kettle drum--will not give you away, but no, the she-wolf makes no move towards you. And thus you walk away, backwards at first, keeping her in sight, and then, when she is lost in the darkness, normally forward, but calmly and slowly, so as to give no grounds for pursuit.

She watches you until you have vanished from sight. A small wolf--her child--joins her on the path, a plaintive whine in its throat. No food, mother? No, little one, no food. For she dares not pursue you.

Still on a path in the forest
From this part of the winding path you can see the baron's castle rising in the east, three leaning towers silhouetted against the starry sky. A trail of footprints--yours--indicates the path back west to the village. You hear nothing; so close to the baron's demesne, even the wolves are silent.

>e

Before the castle gate
The castle's drawbridge has been lowered, twenty meters of wooden boards that allow you to cross the deep moat to the north. On the other side a massive gate guards the entrance to the keep, but the doors are wide open. From where you are standing, the three towers appear to reach to the heavens, and the hordes of gargoyles that people the walls stare down at you disapprovingly.

The sound of flapping wings makes you look up, where the battlements, towers and monstrous gargoyles of the castle are outlined against the star-filled sky. One of the gargoyles has spread his wings, and with slow flaps sails down to the drawbridge. A few steps in front of you, he lands, a stone demon as big as a man. Two ink-black eyes stare at you intently.

Then the gargoyle says with a voice like tearing rock: "It takes courage not to be diverted from the path you have chosen. But won't you just keep going in circles if you never confront the threat?"

(1) "If your life is satisfactory and pleasant, why would you want to confront threats? What is wrong with going in circles, as long as the circle is easy going?"
(2) "My aim is clear, my path is straight. I am here to get my daughter, and I will not shun a confrontation with the baron."
(3) "The most important thing is to remain true to one's self, and to make sure that external forces do not divert you from the path your soul has determined for you. Authenticity trumps everything, even it it leads to circles."

Select an option >> 1

The gargoyle regards you thoughtfully, as if considering your answer. The he nods, once.

"Again you come here," he goes on to say, "to fail once more. Do you still believe that it will ever end differently?"

(1) "You are mistaken. This is the first time I've come here."
(2) "'Again'? You mean that I have already been here, that I have penetrated the baron's castle before?"
(3) "Again and again and again, and so on throughout eternity, until I manage to bring it to an end. There is always another chance."
(4) "No, I cannot change. I have tried, as you well know. But the circle of fate is too strong: I am doomed to walk for eternity, and with each circuit I paint my soul a deeper shade of black."

Select an option >> 1
"So you have forgotten again." In the unearthly bass of the gargoyle, you hear tiredness and pity. "You come here every night, I speak to you every night, every night you lose the fight, and the next night you once again stand before me with filled with naive courage. If you keep closing your eyes to your own deeds, you will never overcome yourself!"

(1) [Firm] "Be silent, devil! I am here for the first time, and your lies cannot take my courage away from me."
(2) [With a panicky voice] "No, no, you are mistaken or trying to deceive me! I have never been here before, and it will not be necessary for me to come here again!"
(3) Try to remember whether you have been here before.

Select an option >> 3
You close your eyes and start digging in the depths of your mind. Images appear: of a dragon, and of one fiery death after another; of the she-wolf--how you have killed her, have scared her away, have calmed her, have howled with her, have fed her with your own flesh and blood...the images merge with each other, blur, lose all structure--you see the gargoyle, you hear fragments of conversations you have had with him, now friendly and consoling, then aggressive and condemning. And then, at the top of a high spiral staircase, you step into the throne room of the baron, and he turns around and you see...but here you find no more images. You have never seen him, or your memory has abandoned you.

(1) [Lie] "I can't remember that at all. I am here for the first time."
(2) "But, my god, but how is this possible? How can it be that I undertake this quest every night?"
(3) "God, everything returns to me. Night after night after night...will this circle never stop? Am I doomed to keep walking it forever?"

Select an option >> 2
"Because you never achieve the victory that really counts. Unfortunately," he raises his hands apologetically, "unfortunately my insight in the essence of your fight is no greater than what you yourself know about it. But I can tell you about mine, and perhaps you can learn from it"

(1) "Yes, tell me about your sorrow. I feel that we are kindred souls."
(2) "I am sorry, but I have to rescue my daughter. I will come back another time to speak with you."

Select an option >> 2
The gargoyle laughs a grinding laugh. "I do not doubt that for a moment! Good luck, until next time, and next time and next time and so on throughout our damned eternity!"

He turns around, and with several beats of his wings he takes off, circles around the castle and then disappears into the darkness of the night.

>l

Before the castle gate
The castle's drawbridge has been lowered, twenty meters of wooden boards that allow you to cross the deep moat to the north. On the other side a massive gate guards the entrance to the keep, but the doors are wide open. From where you are standing, the three towers appear to reach to the heavens, and the hordes of gargoyles that people the walls stare down at you disapprovingly.

>x castle
Almost as in a fairy tale, the white castle rises from the snow. An enormous gate guards the only entrance. Two smaller towers, to the left and to the right of the gate, lean frightfully forward, as if they could fall over any moment. But it is the middle tower that truly inspires awe: dozens of meters high, it always seems to lean towards you no matter where you stand, ready to crush you as soon as soon as it has the chance. Black gargoyles adorn the walls everywhere.

>n

The castle's hall
Behind a facade of intactness a true ruin hides itself. Half the walls of the completely empty hall have fallen down, and the moonlight enters unhindered past the skeleton of a roof. The rest of the castle is in no better state: large, snow-covered heaps of stone indicate were buildings used to be. Only to the east a doorway leads to a hall that is mainly intact. A few walls of the building to the west still stand erect, and to the northwest a narrow path winds between a boulder and a massive statue to the castle's courtyard.

>nw

In the courtyard
From here the state of the castle can be easily appraised. Both of the smaller towers have collapsed completely on the inside, and can no longer be climbed. In contrast, the large tower, which lies at the north side of the courtyard, seems mostly intact. Most of the buildings have been reduced to no more than rubble; only the ruin to the south and the two halls in the southeast retain some structure.

>n

At the bottom of the middle tower
The circular room is full of stacks of paper that have been put down without any apparent order. Several stacks have toppled over, but they don't quite block the way to the staircase that winds upwards from the middle of the room. Two pairs of muddy footsteps--one of an adult wearing boots, the other of a child on bare feet--lead from the door to the south all the way to the stairs.

>u
You run up the stairs, which turn and turn until you must be almost at the tower's top. There they lead into a large room.

In the baron's chamber
The room is sparsely furnished and dark, illuminated only by the candles of a single chandelier. In the middle of the room lies a bear skin; on the walls hang the stuffed heads of wolves, reindeer and other large mammals. In the back of the room is a large stone throne, inlaid with fierce rubies that reflect the light of the chandelier thousandfold. Behind it, on the northern side of the chamber, are two large bronze doors.

On the throne is the baron.

>x baron
A muscled man, in his late forties, has pulled an ermine cloak tightly around him. A sardonic smile plays around his lips as he drums with his fingers on the throne. Now and then he reaches up to readjust the heavy crown on his head.

>talk to baron
"You have to understand," the baron says before you have been able to say anything, "that I have acted only from the most noble of motives. At each point, it has been my only wish to make your daughter happy."

(1) [Enraged] "Happy? Even your beastly brain cannot be so perverted that you believe these lies!"
(2) [Sadly] "No, that is not true. Her happiness has never been the aim of your actions."
(3) [Tiredly] "Spare me your lies--our lies. I have heard them too often, and too often have I learnt to recognise them for the pathetic self-justifications they are."

Select an option >> 3
"I see that you have understood the situation; you have seen through us and discovered our true nature. But--I hardly dare to propose this, but perhaps I can help you? Do you know that I, you, we both are quite guiltless, and should not be condemned for what we have done and what we will do?"

(1) "Why? How could it possibly be the case that here--here!--condemnation is inappropriate?"
(2) "Don't say a word. It are only my own fantasies and chimeras you put into words."
(3) Kill the baron before he can convince you of anything.

Select an option >> 2
The baron watches you uncertainly. "Wait," he says. "You don't know what I want to tell you! It is always good to listen to the wise advice of..."

(1) "Be silent, specter, and come here. This masquerade has lasted long enough."

Select an option >> 1
"No, let us talk about this like...no...no!"

Against his will, apparently, the baron rises from his throne and starts walking towards you. You open your arms to embrace him; he does the same, even though his face is a mask of pure terror. When the two of you fall into each others arms, you feel how his body, his spirit, his essence merges with yours...after a few moments you are alone in the room. The baron has returned to where he came from: your soul. Only his crown lies before you on the throne.

>x crown
Dull metal forms a single round ring, without decorations, without gems, without engravings: only a simple band without interruptions that goes round and round eternally, made to fit a man's head.

>take it
Taken.

>wear crown
You grab the metal circle with two hands, and carefully put it on your head. The crown is heavy and presses painfully on your mind.

>i
You are carrying:
  a crown (being worn)
  an axe
  a winter coat (being worn)
  a teddy
  your work clothes (being worn)

>open doors
As soon as you walk towards the doors they start swinging open, away from you--behind them lies nothing but darkness. You walk onwards, and when you cross the threshold the left door falls crashes down, emitting the sound of a huge copper gong. Immediately afterwards, the right door falls down too and another tremendous, harrowing dissonance resounds. You take another step, and are standing...


On the landing
The landing is enveloped by uneven darkness. A red door to the north leads to the room of your daughter Maartje. Next to the stairs down stands a wooden cupboard, above which a large ornate mirror in a gilded frame beholds you accusingly.

>x mirror
The face of the baron stares at you from the mirror.

>break mirror
Furiously, you smash your fist against the baron's face as it is reflected by the mirror's glass. The mirror fractures, and falls down in many small fragments and one large shard.

>x shard
A large shard from the mirror, cold and sharp as ice.

>take it
Taken.

> pray
(1) “Merciful God, please forgive me the crime I am about to commit.”
(2) “Please, God, give me the strength to conquer my lust.”
(3) “Dear God, I don’t ask anything for myself, but please save my daughter Maartje.”

Select an option >> 1
Do you believe that God will forgive your crime?

(1) Yes.
(2) No.

Select an option >> 2

>kill me
You stare at the razor-sharp piece of glass, but you know that there is nothing else to do. You put the point of the shard on the skin of your wrist, exactly where the artery is, and press. A drop of blood wells up from the small hole.

Do you have the courage to go on with this?

(1) Yes. I am strong enough.
(2) No. I cannot do it.

Select an option >> 1
With a fierce slash you cut in the direction of your arm, opening the artery over a length of inches. Bright red blood spurts out, over your hands, over the shard, over your nightshirt, over the floor. You sink to your knees. Now it is only a matter of time.

While your life flows away slowly, questions arise in your mind, questions to which the answers are suddenly very clear.

Was this the easy way out?

(1) Yes. I could not continue living with this guilt.
(2) No. It was the hardest sacrifice I ever made.

Select an option >> 1
Will Maartje ever forgive you?

(1) No. No matter whether I have ruined her life forever or not, she will always hate me.
(2) Yes. With time the wounds will heal and her hate will diminish; and perhaps there will be a day when she will understand me, just a little, and when she will feel just a very tiny amount of pity--or perhaps, even of love.
